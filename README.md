# Salary Prediction Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Business Problem: 
To ensure there is no discrimination between employees, it is imperative for the Human Resources department of Company X to maintain a salary range for each employee with a similar profile. Apart from the existing salary, a considerable number of factors, such as an employee’s experience and other abilities, are evaluated during interviews. Given the data related to individuals who applied to Company X, models can be built that automatically determine the salary to be offered if a prospective candidate is selected. This model seeks to minimize human judgment in salary decisions.


## 📌 Goal & Objective: 
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data, that will determine the salary to be offered to an employee, minimizing manual judgment in the selection process. The approach aims to be robust and eliminate any discrimination in salary among employees with similar profiles.
